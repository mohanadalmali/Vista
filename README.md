🎬 Vista – Video Intelligence AI

Vista is a modern web application designed to analyze video content, extract transcripts, and generate AI-powered insights instantly.
The application leverages DeepSeek LLM to produce comprehensive summaries, topic clustering, and key highlights from YouTube videos or uploaded transcript files.

This project was developed as a Graduation Project, aiming to demonstrate the practical integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with video data processing and natural language understanding.

🚀 Key Features
📺 YouTube Integration

Extracts metadata and time-stamped transcripts directly from YouTube URLs

No need to download the video file

📂 File Support

Supports manual upload of .txt transcript files

Enables offline analysis

🧠 AI-Powered Analysis (DeepSeek)

Executive Summary – Concise overview of video content

Topic Clustering – Groups and categorizes main discussion topics

Key Highlights – Extracts the most impactful sentences and quotes

🎨 Modern User Interface

Built with Streamlit

Clean, responsive design with Dark Mode support

⬇️ Data Export

Download processed transcripts and AI outputs as .txt files
